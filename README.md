This project is for Real Estate market analysis and understanding the price per sqft and features in Calgary to get the prime property for purchase. 
<br><br>Due to the recent inflation price hikes, real estate prices are adjusting quickly; investors and buyers are waiting on the side, looking for the best investment property.
<br><br>I built a data warehouse that gets ingestion from scraping website data from zillow.com and connected a dashboard that displays all information and is updated every week. <br>

* Application:
