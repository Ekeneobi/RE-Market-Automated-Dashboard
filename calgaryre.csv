Welcome home to 8216 Churchill Drive SW, a unique 2 storey split layout with modern upgrades located in a community with mature trees, parks, a smooth commute downtown and several nearby schools including one right down the street.  One of our favourite features is the separation of spaces in this home. Being a split level each area has a couple of distinct uses. As you enter the main door, the large foyer is the ideal size to handle the chaos of a family trying to get out the door with all their stuff. Just off to the left, through french doors is a large family room that could double as an office, another bedroom, a gym, whatever you want. This room leads to the main floor bedroom that is just across the hall from the 3 piece bathroom. Up just a few steps to the main living area, you’ll find a ton of updates and upgrades but still a lot of the mid century charm that makes these houses so desirable. Hardwood is the floor of choice throughout the main living area, and the living room features an original wood burning fireplace. The kitchen was completely renovated just a few years ago with all new cabinets, counters and backsplash. Upstairs is the bedroom area, which also features hardwood floors, and a completely renovated 5 piece bathroom. The basement went through a complete transformation with new floors, and features tons of built-ins, a bar area, and a chalkboard wall!!! Some of the other upgraded features in this home are newer windows, a newer roof, tankless hot water, and completely updated electrical. Outside, the yard is fantastic.

We love this house because it is a fantastic size for a family, it has gone through extensive updates but kept a lot of its mid-century charm, and is in Chinook Park.
